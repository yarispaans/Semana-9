          <h3>#1 GREEN VALLEY</h3>
          <p>Location: Camboriú,Brazil | Capacity: 12,000. They've done it again! The club that topped the poll in 2013 and 2015 — and has been in the top three all decade — has risen to the apex once more for 2018. So it's congratulations to Green Valley in Brazil, who even had world class footballer Neymar supporting their campaign again this year.</p>

          <h3>#3 ZOUK SINGAPORE</h3>
          <p>Location: Singapore | Capacity: 2,600. The word institution is thrown around far too readily when it comes to clubs, but Zouk Singapore legitimately lives up to that title. Not just as a world-renowned club with an illustrious history and global influence dating back to 1991, but because it’s been able to entirely relocate to a new location and venue and still retain its atmosphere, status and loyal following.</p>

            <h3>#5 HÏ IBIZA</h3>
            <p>Location: Ibiza, Spain | Capacity: 3,000. Starting life on the former site of DJ Mag’s number one club Space, Hï Ibiza had a lot to live up to. It did it with impressive style, re-imagining the legendary location into a remarkable clubbing experience with state-of-the-art sound and lighting coupled and forward-thinking residents, nodding gracefully to all aspects of the island’s diverse musical history.</p>

            <h3>#7 OCTAGON</h3>
            <p>Location: Seoul, South Korea | Capacity: 3,000. Octagon is one of Seoul’s most popular nightlife destinations and no stranger to the DJ Mag Top 100 club listings. Last year the South Korean hotspot was number five in the running, for the second year in a row. Nestled beneath the New Hilltop Hotel close to the Han River, Octagon was once a three-storey basement karaoke bar but now resembles more of an industrial.</p>

            <h3>#9 FABRIC</h3>
            <p>Location: London, UK | Capacity: 1,600. There’s a strong case for Fabric being London’s ultimate club. No other venue has held so steadfast in its mission. Located on the site of a former meat storage unit in Farringdon, the club has maintained an underground ethos since it opened in October 1999. Its key promotions Fabriclive (bass music variants twice a month on Fridays) and Fabric (house, techno and electro on Fridays and Saturdays).</p>

          <h3>#2 USHUAïA</h3>
          <p>Location: Playa D’en Bossa, Ibiza | Capacity: 5,000. Ever since it arrived in 2011, Ushuaïa has always been about setting new standards when it comes to luxury clubbing experiences in Ibiza. The club makes no bones about that and prides itself on combining premium accommodation with huge international headliners.</p>

          <h3>#4 ECHOSTAGE</h3>
          <p>Location: Washington, D.C., USA | Capacity: 3,000. The vision behind Echostage was always clear: a hybrid nightclub and concert venue that offers an immersive outdoor festival experience year-round with the comfort and convenience of an indoor space. Finding that sweet spot between the intimacy of a nightclub/concert venue and the bombast of a festival was born out of necessity to satisfy the growing EDM fanbase.</p>

          <h3>#6 PAPAYA</h3>
          <p>Location: Zrce Beach, Island of Pag, Croatia | Capacity: 3,500. Given its location — right on the seafront — Papaya’s famous swimming pools almost seem redundant. That is until you see them in the throws of the club’s so-called ‘after beach parties’ — famously debauched late-afternoon affairs that have well and truly promoted this Croatian mainstay into the global dance music Premier League.</p>

          <h3>#8 PACHA IBIZA</h3>
          <p>Location: Ibiza, Spain<br>Capacity: 3,000. For many Ibiza regulars, Pacha is the definitive club on the island. Having first sprung up there in 1973, the brand has spread far and wide, opening sister clubs in Brazil, the USA, Germany, Australia and more. While Ibiza wasn’t the first Pacha opened, it’s considered the home of the famous cherry brand, with Pacha basing their HQ on the White Isle.</p>

          <h3>#10 BERGHAIN</h3>
          <p>Location: Berlin, Germany | Capacity: 1,500. It’s one of the most secretive places in the world, but Berghain is also one of the most globally respected nightclubs to open its doors in the past few decades. Formerly named Ostgut (the inspiration behind its label counterpart, Ostgut Ton) it was a home for notorious male fetish parties in the late ‘90s, and in 2004 found a permanent fixture in the former power plant now called Berghain located in the Friedrichshain district.</p>
