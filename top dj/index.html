    <h3>#1 MARTIN GARRIX</h3>
    <p>Last year, Martin Garrix made history when he became the youngest ever winner of the Top 100 DJs poll. Having rapidly climbed the chart over the past few years, he pipped legendary winners such as Tiësto, Armin van Buuren and Hardwell to the top spot, and knocked Dimitri Vegas & Like Mike off the throne.</p>

    <h3>#2 DIMITRI VEGAS AND LIKE MIKE</h3>
    <p>Another year, another madness: Belgian/Greek brothers Dimitri Vegas & Like Mike remain in the upper EDM echelons as two of the most personable, ambitious and hardest working men in the big room game. Having signed out 2016 with another sold-out run of arena shows in Belgium (performing to a staggering total of 84,000 fans), they kick-started a whole slew of big moves this year with a major-league Diplo collaboration: ‘Hey Baby’, a euphoric pop-dance ditty that smashed the top spot in their home country and the US Billboard charts.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="c2">
    <img src="images/Armin-van-Buuren.png" alt="">
    <h3>#3 ARMIN VAN BUUREN</h3>
    <p>While Martin Garrix may have once again won the title this year, when it comes to long-term success in the Top 100 DJs, every other DJ in the poll could learn a thing or two from Armin van Buuren. Now 40 years old — but still looking and sounding as fresh as DJs half his age — Armin marks his 16th appearance in the chart in 2017. First placing way back in 2001, the Dutchman jumped in at No. 27; the next year he made it all the way to fifth place, and hasn’t left the top five since!</p>
  </div>
  <div class="c2">
    <img src="images/HARDWELL.png" alt="">
    <h3>#4 HARDWELL</h3>
    <p>As one of the few DJ/producers who has scaled all the way to the top of the Top 100 DJs poll with two consecutive No.1 wins, Hardwell continues his reign this year as EDM’s renaissance man. DJ, producer, label owner, charity ambassador, tech guru and… fragrance mascot.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="c2">
    <img src="images/TIESTO.png" alt="">
    <h3>#5 TIËSTO</h3>
    <p>Tiësto is the unstoppable machine who may as well utter the words “I'll be back” each year after we announce his place in this poll, such is his enduring popularity. If you can't see the Arnie comparison, then look for something of the shapeshifting qualities of the T-1000 from Terminator 2 instead.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="c2">
    <img src="images/THE CHAINSMOKERS.png" alt="">
    <h3>#6 THE CHAINSMOKERS</h3>
    <p>If there's one act that transported the colourful, build-and-release template of EDM into a chart-topping formula, it's The Chainsmokers. Their sound is a schlocky fusion of dance music tropes and pop bravado, with addictive hooks and cleverly selected collaborators. </p>
  </div>
  <div class="c2">
    <img src="images/DAVID GUETTA.png" alt="">
    <h3>#7 DAVID GUETTA</h3>
    <p>For the last two decades, DJ/producer and showman David Guetta has been one of the biggest names in dance music. Whether you’re an EDM devotee or an underground raver there’s little doubt you have heard of the ubiquitous Frenchman, who’s been holding his Ushuaia residency for the last few years in Ibiza, alongside regularly topping the charts with a slew of hit singles and pop-fuelled remixes. </p>
  </div>
  <div class="c2">
    <img src="images/AFROJACK.png" alt="">
    <h3>#8 AFROJACK</h3>
    <p>First appearing in this poll way, way back in 2010, within 12 months Nick Van de Wall — aka Afrojack — had catapulted into our top 10, dropping out just once in the years since (and even then it was only down to No.12).</p>
  </div>
  <div class="c2">
    <img src="images/STEVE AOKI.png" alt="">
    <h3>#9 STEVE AOKI</h3>
    <p>To anyone else, Steve Aoki’s life is a whirlwind of gigs, studio time and travel. But it’s business as usual for the fondant-flinging EDM supremo. Even though he’s slipped a couple of places in the poll, he’s still standing strong in the top ten.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="c2">
    <img src="images/MARSHMELLO.png" alt="">
    <h3>#10 MARSHMELLO</h3>
    <p>One thing cannot be disputed: Marshmello is one of a kind. Disguised by a white cylindrical helmet that flashes, and armed with enough sugary dancefloor dynamite to melt hearts as well as ears, it's fair to suggest that the 'Mello's take on trap, electro and EDM is anything but mellow.</p>
